How To host the website on brooklyn college 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need login into the brooklyn college network using terminal/cmd/putty
Then make a folder named "public_html" then u want to copy the Whack-A-Pro.git into the
"public_html" folder. You can use cp -r whack-A-Pro.git /public_html then once you have done
you can go to use browser and type "acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~username" then press enter 
and you will see the dir of whack-a-pro.git and you know what to do from there and then click 
on the html file and *BOOM*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The logic with the Whack-A-Professor need to change and need to be alittle bit more better,
Also there is a problem with the scoring systems. 

Some time when you click on the other chacter like student or dean, the points some how 
carry over. For Example: if i click dean which is 20 point and then click professor for 
15, some how after clicking professor I just an extra 20 point to my score which I have 
already gotten from dean.

The dir is a problem too because the ../ method doesnt work for other but does work for
other people for some reason and idk why. People say its bad practice (dont quote me on that)

Also for the play again button, I had tried but its not working, So we are going to let the
play again button refresh the page

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Finished
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play Button

The pop in’s and out’s of other element (professor, dean, student) (admin is not in yet
but waiting for graphics to give us the img)

If have a Score time but need to be better

He have a background, Img SHOULD be design and be in it rightful play

The timer and fully working
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To-Do’s / Might
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** == Mights
Someone need to look at the CSS and do some designing

We need to add sound to the every ‘hit’ (waiting for the sounds)

We need to have a database (text file) to keep the score and we might have to make a ’tab*
or a ‘outter box’ that will show who got the hits score and we might have to use username and t
hen make it alphabatic order.

*** Might have a img or replace or change/ add the start button, title screen, game-over
button or game-over screen
