		<div>
			<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4 id="Purpose">1.1: Purpose</h4>
			<p>This document represents the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Whack-A-Prof. It is designed to specify the procedures our teams, backbone, quality assurance, specification documentation, and graphics, have used in the development process and describe the requirements specifications for our application with respect to end users. It will provide a detailed overview of our software product’s goals and parameters.</p>
			<h4 id="Document-Conventions">1.2: Document Conventions</h4>
			<p>When going through the final version of the document, specific typographical conventions are implemented to make the consumption of this document’s information easier for you. When sentences or phrases are <b>bolded</b> or <ins>underlined</ins>, it usually means that there is a change in topic. In other instances <b>bolded</b> words or phrases are used to emphasize something important that the reader must keep in mind. Headers are used to indicate the topic that will be discussed in each section. When a sentence or word is surrounded by “quotations” the sentence or word is from a source or an idea that is not originally ours. Bullet points, or lists, are used to easily list information in order to avoid confusing paragraphs. Lines and dividers in the document are used to have further organization of information for the reader to easily see when a section starts and ends. Finally, any links provided in the document are there to show what it is that we are referencing and where the outside sources we use come from. The only other time you will see a link that does not do this is in the table of contents. The table of contents is there to show the different sections in the specification document, and the links in each section allow the user to quickly go to the section with a click.</p>
			<h4 id="Intended-Audience">1.3: Intended Audience</h4>
			<p>
			This SRS is organized into 4 sections, each with varying subsections. The document is intended for both technical and non-technical audiences, 
			such as developers, users, testers, and documentation writers. All readers should start with the <strong>Introduction</strong> and <strong>Overall Description</strong>to get a 
			sense of the purpose and scope of the product. Users should follow the User Documentation (subsection 2.6) which will give a general tutorial 
			on how to use the product. Section 3: <strong>External Interface Requirements</strong> and Section 4: <strong>System Features</strong> are intended for developers, testers, 
			and documentation writers. These two sections will give specific details on the software features of the product itself.
			</p>
			<h4 id="Product-Scope">1.4: Product Scope</h4>
			<p>The skeleton of the project will be created using the scripting language of Javascript. The goal with Javascript is to create the bare minimum functions of a “Whack-A-Prof” game. Javascript will be responsible for signifying the space in which the game will take place, animating the pictures that will represent the characters and the cursor, buttons, etc. that the user will be using to interact with the game. Additionally, Javascript will be giving these characters value, allowing the user to feel a form of interaction with said characters by gaining or losing points based on what character they have interacted with. The space and structure that the game will be developed in will be created by HTML. HTML will display the game on a web browser and create containers and borders in which the buttons, characters, and other visual blocks will be placed in. Moreover, while HTML will be able to visually show the user the game, CSS will further assist HTML in giving better visual effects to the web browser. On the other hand, Aseprite and LibreSprite will be used to create the visuals of the characters. Both programs are sprite and pixel art editing tools. Moreover, Skia, a 2D graphics library, Ninja, a build system, CMake, an open source software that generates a system’s build file, and PureRef, an image referencing tool, will be used by the design team to assist in the designing of the characters. Finally, GitHub and the SVN service provided by GitHub are used by everyone in the team in order to keep programs, pictures, documents, and other forms of files in one organized and accessible setting.</p>

			<h4 id = "Product-Perspective">2.1: Product Perspective</h4>
			<p>
				This product is a new “Whack- A-Mole” inspired game where the functions are the same but the settings are altered. Instead of moles, the user will interact with school faculty and students to accumulate or depress points. The following are features included with the web game:

				<ul>
					<li>Cross Platform Support: The game is supported by most of the popular web browsers that can be downloaded in most operating systems.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Number of users who can be on the website: While an exact number can not be given a sizeable amount of users can go on the website at the same time to play the game.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Storing Scores of User: The website will be utilizing the user's local storage in order to keep track of their individual scores.</li>

				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4 id = "Product-Functions">2.2: Product Functions</h4>
			<p>
				The product must provide, at a minimum, the following functions to the users within this SRS document:

				<ul>
					<li>Provide a User Interface (UI) to play the game</li>
					<br>
					<li>Make data/scores available in local storage</li>
					<br>
					<li>Allow users to click buttons to start the game, restart the game, and return to the home page</li>
					<br>
					<li>Display a tutorial on the home page for guidance on how to play the game</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4 id = "User-Classes-And-Characteristics">2.3: User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
			<p>
				Users of the product should have basic knowledge of web technology and operating the internet. The user interface will be friendly enough to guide the user and help with starting the Whack-A-Prof game.
			</p>

			<h4 id = "Operating-Environment">2.4: Operating Enviroment</h4>
			<p>
				The server-side components of the software system can operate on any operating system, including but not limited to Linux, Windows, and macOS. The client-side components of the software system must operate within common web browser environments. The minimum set of browsers that must be supported is:

				<ul>
					<li>Google Chrome</li>
					<br>
					<li>Apple Safari</li>
					<br>
					<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
					<br>
					<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
					<br>
					<li>Fedora WS 36</li>
					<br>
					<li>Visual Studio Code V. 1.72.2</li>
					<br>
					<li>Notepad++ v8.4.6</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4 id = "Design-And-Implementation-Constraints">2.5: Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
			<p>
				This program will have complications when used on a tablet or phone as it is designed to be better played on a desktop or laptop. Additionally, the game doesn't have adequate backend security because of how Javascript is structured and there is no user authentication. However, the only data or information that will be vulnerable to the user is their score from the game which will be stored in a text file. Finally, not all errors and bugs with the code will be caught immediately. 
			</p>

			<h4 id = "User-Documentation">2.6: User Documentation</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Tutorial Overview:</li>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>The game assumes basic knowledge of the original "Whack-A-Mole" arcade game. Users start by pressing on the start button on the title screen that will take them to the game screen. At the game screen, they will utilize their mouse and cursor to interact with the sprites on the screen. The user may use the cursor, which will assume a hammer, to hit the sprites. If professors, deans, and admins are hit, the user will gain points. If the user hits a student, they lose points. The game ends when the timer reaches 0 seconds and the player can compete with themselves for higher score.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Walkthrough:</li>
				<br>
				<li>Rules:</li>
				<br>
			</ul>

			<h4 id = "Assumptions-and-Dependencies">2.7: Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
			<p>
				Users must access the game through a desktop. If the game is accessed through any other devices or browsers that are otherwise not listed in Section 2.4, it may bug or become unplayable. Users who play this game are assumed to have access to a usable web browser and know how to use the internet and input devices, such as the mouse, which is a key feature in playing the game.

				When the game first launches, there will be an animation displaying the name of the game, Whack-A-Prof, and the class that worked on this project, CISC 3140 (Figure 1). The start game screen (Figure 2) will display the title of the game, start game button, and tutorial button, respectively. The start game screen will also have its individual background visual. Clicking the tutorial button will trigger the tutorial screen (Figure 3). This screen includes the title, tutorial text, a visual key showcasing the characters respectively. Clicking the back home button will trigger the title screen to appear once again. Additionally the tutorial-screen will have the same visual background as the title screen. When clicking the Start Game button, the Game Screen will be triggered (Figure 4) where the title, current score, timer, and the gameboard will be shown respectively. The gameboard will consist of 9 holes laid out in a 3x3 grid. The sprites that will be transitioning out of the holes are either professors, admins, or students. Once the timer is at 0 seconds, the game over screen (Figure 5) will be initiated. There will be a game over text, score, high score, play again button, and home button, respectively. The game over screen will also have its own visual background different from the rest.

			<h4 id = "Hardware-Interfaces">3.2: Hardware Interfaces</h4>
			<p>
				The client-side components of Whack-A-Prof can be executed on both personal-class computers and workstation-class computers. The game will require browser support and an internet connection to run it.
			</p>

			<h4 id = "Software-Interfaces"> 3.3: Software Interfaces</h4>
			<p>
				The game requires Javascript support in order to be run on a browser. The game should be supported in all browsers however the game has full support on a firefox browser. There are only compatibility issues when the size of the screen is too big because the proportions of the background and other graphical features can be altered.

						<li>The sprites or sprite target will appear on the screen once the game begins and when the sprite spawns have both visually and functionally been triggered. The sprite target is high priority because the sprites are used to allow user interaction with the game as the sprites are what change the amount of points or time the user can accumulate. Users click on the sprite and that will cause the timer to increase in value and the score of the user to either increase or decrease depending on what sprite target was clicked on.</li>
