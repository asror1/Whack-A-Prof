### **1.1: Purpose** <a name="Purpose"></a>
This document represents the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Whack-A-Prof. It is designed to specify the procedures our teams, backbone, quality assurance, specification documentation, and graphics, have used in the development process and describe the requirements specifications for our application with respect to end users. It will provide a detailed overview of our software product’s goals and parameters.

### **1.2: Document Conventions** <a name="Document-Conventions"></a>

When going through the final version of the document, specific typographical conventions are implemented to make the consumption of this document’s information easier for you. When sentences or phrases are **bolded** or <ins>underlined</ins>, it usually means that there is a change in topic. In other instances **bolded** words or phrases are used to emphasize something important that the reader must keep in mind. Headers are used to indicate the topic that will be discussed in each section. When a sentence or word is surrounded by “quotations” the sentence or word is from a source or an idea that is not originally ours. Bullet points, or lists, are used to easily list information in order to avoid confusing paragraphs. Lines and dividers in the document are used to have further organization of information for the reader to easily see when a section starts and ends. Finally, any links provided in the document are there to show what it is that we are referencing and where the outside sources we use come from. The only other time you will see a link that does not do this is in the table of contents.
