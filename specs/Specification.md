## **1. Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>
---
### **1.1: Purpose** <a name="Purpose"></a>
<Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.>

### **1.2: Document Conventions** <a name="Document-Conventions"></a>

When going through the final version of the document, specific typographical conventions are implemented to make the consumption of this document’s information easier for you. When sentences or phrases are **bolded** or <ins>underlined</ins>, it usually means that there is a change in topic. In other instances **bolded** words or phrases are used to emphasize something important that the reader must keep in mind. Headers are used to indicate the topic that will be discussed in each section. When a sentence or word is surrounded by “quotations” the sentence or word is from a source or an idea that is not originally ours. Bullet points, or lists, are used to easily list information in order to avoid confusing paragraphs. Lines and dividers in the document are used to have further organization of information for the reader to easily see when a section starts and ends. Finally, any links provided in the document are there to show what it is that we are referencing and where the outside sources we use come from. The only other time you will see a link that does not do this is in the table of contents. The table of contents is there to show the different sections in the specification document, and the links in each section allow the user to quickly go to the section with a click.  


### **1.3: Intended Audience** <a name="Intended-Audience"></a>
<Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type>

### **1.4: Product Scope** <a name="Product-Scope"></a>
<Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here>

### **1.5: References** <a name="References"></a>
<List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location>

## **2. Overall Description** <a name="Overall-Description"></a>
---
### **2.1: Product Perspective** <a name="Product-Perspective"></a>
<Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.>

### **2.2: Product Functions** <a name="Product-Functions"></a>
<Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.>

### **2.3: User Classes and Characteristics** <a name="User-Classes-and-Characteristics"></a>
<Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.>

### **2.4: Operating Environment** <a name="Operating-Environment"></a>
<Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.>

### **2.5: Design and Implementation Constraints** <a name="Design-and-Implementation-Constraints"></a>
<Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software)>

### **2.6: User Documentation** <a name="User-Documentation"></a>
<List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.>

### **2.7: Assumptions and Dependencies** <a name="Assumptions-and-Dependencies"></a>
<List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>
